# commons-java-pager
In the java web development, paging has become an indispensable component. I have worked on many java web project, revised several times in the project page component (or call tools). But I finally found that, regardless of how to change, there are some basic algorithm is not changed. So I take this as an open source project contribution to it. I hope to help solve the problem of paging logic in the algorithm.
